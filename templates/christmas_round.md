Create a perfectly CIRCULAR ornament design. IMPORTANT: Everything must fit INSIDE the circle - no elements extending beyond the circular border.

IMPORTANT COMPOSITION RULES:
- Do NOT include an ornament hanger, hole, or hook at the top
- Keep the top area clear of important elements (subject's face, text)
- The design should be a complete circular composition

The circle should contain:
- Christmas string lights forming a ring INSIDE the circular edge
- A festive Christmas background with snowy village, presents, teddy bears, and sleigh
- The baby/subject from this image in the center (positioned center or slightly lower), dressed in {clothing_prompt}
- Keep the baby's face and features EXACTLY as they appear
- Professional holiday atmosphere with warm lighting

The entire composition must be contained within a perfect circle. Nothing should extend outside the circular boundary. This is for a circular ornament or sticker design - complete and seamless with no hanging hardware.
